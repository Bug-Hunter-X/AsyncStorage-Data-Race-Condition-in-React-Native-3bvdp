This React Native bug arises when using AsyncStorage to store and retrieve data.  The issue stems from improperly handling the asynchronous nature of AsyncStorage's operations, often leading to unexpected behavior or crashes.  Specifically, attempting to access data before AsyncStorage has finished setting it, or assuming the data will always exist, can result in errors. For example, using the returned value of `AsyncStorage.setItem` directly without awaiting completion can lead to using an undefined value.
